### An application that attempts to generate all possible tic-tac-toe boards of a given size and with a given line length.

The "logs" folder contains pre-made logs for several board sizes; the naming format is [height]x[width]_l[line length]_log.

Be aware that generating large boards will slow down the program immensely; the largest board I was able to generate in a reasonable time frame was 4x3.
